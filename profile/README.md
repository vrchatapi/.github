## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

Before we begin, we would like to state this is a **COMMUNITY DRIVEN PROJECT**.
This means that everything you read on here was written by the community itself and is **not** officially supported by VRChat.
The documentation is provided "AS IS", and any action you take towards VRChat is completely your own responsibility.

The documentation and additional libraries SHALL ONLY be used for applications interacting with VRChat's API in accordance
with their [Terms of Service](https://hello.vrchat.com/legal) and [Community Guidelines](https://hello.vrchat.com/community-guidelines), and MUST NOT be used for modifying the client, "avatar ripping", or other illegal activities.
Malicious usage or spamming the API may result in account termination.
Certain parts of the API are also more sensitive than others, for example moderation, so please tread extra carefully and read the warnings when present.

Finally, use of the API using applications other than the approved methods (website, VRChat application, Unity SDK) is not officially supported.
VRChat provides no guarantee or support for external applications using the API. Access to API endpoints may break **at any time, without notice**.
Therefore, please **do not ping** VRChat Staff in the VRChat Discord if you are having API problems, as they do not provide API support.

It is beautiful developing API documentation, not only because it will help yourself in your own projects, but because it allows others to create stuff you yourself wouldn't even think of, thereby greatly improving the experience for everyone!
